It is estimated that 2 million women are effected by breast cancer in 2018 alone. This is the second most common type of cancers among women and can be cured when diagnosed in early stages. In medical terminology, a malignant cancer is that which is not prone to spread in the body where the benign is that tends to spread.

Since we are going to predict that if the subject is a malignant or benign, this is a classification problem.
The dataset used for this problem  can be downloaded in UCI Machine Learning repository and can be imported directly from sklearn.datasets library of python. We are going to use Support Vector Machine algorithm for train the model.
